## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is well defined (4 pt)
## Results:
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)
## Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
