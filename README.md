## Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
